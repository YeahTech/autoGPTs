## Installation

Currently, the autoGPTs extension is not available on the Chrome Web Store. You can manually install the extension by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode".
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will run automatically in the background without needing manual activation. The extension will autonomously perform the following tasks:

- Automatically click the "Allow" button in dialog boxes when GPTs attempt to invoke external actions.
- Automatically input the command to "execute the next step" until a task is completed.

## Features

Current features include:

1. **Automatic Permission for External Actions**: Automatically clicks the allow button in dialog boxes, removing the need for manual user intervention when GPTs invoke external actions.
2. **Automated Task Execution**: Inputs the command to execute the next step automatically, ensuring a seamless task execution process until completion.

## To-Do

- [ ] Implement calling LLMs (Large Language Models) to control GPTs.
- [ ] Develop features for multiple GPTs to collaborate on tasks based on automated motion functionality.
